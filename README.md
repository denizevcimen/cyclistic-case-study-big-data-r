This is a case study in the Capstone Projects Course which is the last step of Google's Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I have previously completed this case study with sample datasets using R and Google Spreadsheets, SQL, and Tableau. This time I wanted to get experience with Big Data. This project involves analyzing a large dataset with nearly 6,000,000 rows of data. I used R programming and various data analysis techniques to explore the dataset, identify trends, and create insightful visualizations. Also, I update the course guide in the R book because some of them don't work anymore. Check the updated version.

Scenario:
I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analytics team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.

The company has 3 pricing plans which these are:

- Single-ride passes
- Full-day passes
- Annual memberships.
  - Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
  - Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Also, you can visit my blog content [here](https://denizevcimen.com/blog/my-first-data-analytics-project), which addresses the other most common question that was “Is it normal to get stuck during the first data project?”
